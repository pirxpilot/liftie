<p>In an effort to keep Alta skiers skiing, rather than waiting in lift lines, we will be loading our lifts at full capacity this winter. Singles lines will also return this winter, with the intent that singles join other riders rather than riding solo on the chair. While we are fortunate to enjoy a sport in the wide-open mountain air, facemasks and buffs are still encouraged in lift lines.</p>    </div>
